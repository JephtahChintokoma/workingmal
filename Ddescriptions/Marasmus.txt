Malnutrition produced by a severely inadequate amount of carbohydrates or energy or calories in the diet.

Marasmus is mostly found in people living in geographical areas that have limited food resources.  It happens when the intake of nutrients and energy is low for a person's needs.

It leads to wasting, or the loss of body fat, muscle and weight. A child with Marasmus may not grow as children usually do.
